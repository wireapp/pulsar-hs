## Building with Nix Flakes

This project uses Nix flakes for reproducible builds and development environments.

### Build all packages

```bash
nix build
```

### Build specific packages

```bash
nix build .#pulsar-client-hs
nix build .#pulsar-admin
nix build .#pulsar-client-hs-examples
nix build .#pulsar-client-cpp
```

### Development shell

Enter a development environment with all necessary tools (GHC 9.8, cabal, haskell-language-server, etc.):

```bash
nix develop
```

Or use direnv for automatic environment loading:

```bash
direnv allow
```
